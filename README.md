## Project Overview

Magic 8-Ball is a fun and interactive application built using Flutter that simulates the classic Magic 8-Ball game. The app displays a random answer to users' questions as they shake their device or tap the screen. The main goal of this simple yet entertaining project is to provide a delightful and intuitive user experience with elegant animations and user-friendly UI.

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies for its development:

* [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/): A UI toolkit that enables the building of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
